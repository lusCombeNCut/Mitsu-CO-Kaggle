"""
The evaluation API requires that you set up a server which will respond to inference requests.
We have already defined the server; you just need write the predict function.
When we evaluate your submission on the hidden test set the client defined in `mitsui_gateway` will run in a different container
with direct access to the hidden test set and hand off the data timestep by timestep.

Your code will always have access to the published copies of the competition files.
